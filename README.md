# Toast Notification Project

This is a simple **Toast Notification** project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project showcases various toast notification messages such as success, failure, and pending statuses, which can be triggered by buttons on the interface.

## Features
- Responsive and visually appealing design.
- Includes three types of toast notifications:
  - **Success:** Green checkmark with a success message.
  - **Failure:** Red cross with an error message.
  - **Pending:** Yellow warning icon with a pending message.
- Smooth animations for showing and hiding notifications.

## Project Structure
```

|-- styles.css         # CSS styles for layout and animations
```

## Font Used
